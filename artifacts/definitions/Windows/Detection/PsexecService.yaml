name: Windows.Detection.PsexecService
description: |
  PSExec works by installing a new service in the system. The service
  can be renamed using the -r flag and therefore it is not enough to
  just watch for a new service called psexecsvc.exe. This artifact
  improves on this by scanning the service binary to detect the
  original psexec binary.
