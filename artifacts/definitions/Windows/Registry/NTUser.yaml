name: Windows.Registry.NTUser
description: |
  This artifact searches for keys or values within the user's
  NTUser.dat registry hives.

  When a user logs into a windows machine the system creates their own
  "profile" which consists of a registry hive mapped into the
  HKEY_USERS hive. This hive file is locked as long as the user is
  logged in. If the user is not logged in, the file is not mapped at
  all.

  This artifact bypasses the locking mechanism by parsing the raw NTFS
  filesystem to recover the registry hives. We then parse the registry
  hives to search for the glob provided.

  This artifact is designed to be reused by other artifacts that need
  to access user data.
