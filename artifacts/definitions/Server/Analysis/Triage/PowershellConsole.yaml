  This artifact post processes the artifact
  Windows.Triage.Collectors.PowershellConsoleLogs. While that artifact
  just uploads all the powershell console files, we sometimes want to
  easily see all the files in the same output table.

  This artifact simply post processes the uploaded files and puts
  their content in the same table.
